Laptop Price Analysis – Mini Project:
This project analyzes a laptop dataset to explore how different hardware and software features affect laptop prices. The notebook includes data cleaning, feature extraction (RAM, storage type, OS), basic statistics, price distribution, comparisons between companies, RAM vs price analysis, storage type analysis, and outlier detection using IQR and Z‑score. All results are presented through clear visualizations and organized Python code.
